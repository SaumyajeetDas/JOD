Welcome, follow the steps to bypass WINDOWS 11 DEFENDER PROTECTION.

Clone this repository using the following command and lets give permission to the bash file:

$ git clone https://github.com/SaumyajeetDas/JOD.git 
$ chmod +x jod.sh

Now, we will run this script by using the following command:

$ ./jod.sh

The final shellcode will be XOR Encrypted inside jod_output.txt. We will copy it and paste it in the Evasion.cpp file inside the char b[] = { Xored Shellcode };
Now compile it using DevC++. 

Run the executable and wait for few seconds.

METERPRETER SHELL WILL POP UP.
